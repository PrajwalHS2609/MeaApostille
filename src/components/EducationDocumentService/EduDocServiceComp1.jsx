        <p>
          With an expansive rise in remote and hybrid work, we’re having to
          reevaluate our approach to technology. And new approach means new
          challenges, like finding ways to collaborate, communicate, and support
          your remote workers in the same way you provide for your in-office
          employees. This new workstyle can mean new challenges for small
          businesses - but challenges don’t have to mean roadblocks.
